    description= _ "The Samaritans rely on new adepts to join the orders, and some are used as crusing fighter-souts, given a club, and a small supply of javelins. They are then sent to spread fear and despair amongst their enemies, decimating their defenses. Their fear instilling mobile fighting-style leads them to forget regular defense, making them good scouts.

Samaritans or 'Cutheans' are were a very early panethnic group, widely extended and powerful. From Assyria they extended to India, China, Arabia Petraea and Abyssinia. They were impoted by the Assyrian Empire also to Samaria, in a politic of mass-deportations. They had their Samaritan Temple on Mt. Gerizim, opposed to the Temple in Jerusalem, and they worshiped the mesopotamian deity Nergal, his emblem was a cock."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}
